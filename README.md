[ [Online Version](https://lyonbot.github.io/onebox/) ]

Designed for instant note-taking, data handling, quick code validation.

## Who is OneBox For?

OneBox is designed for developers who need a quick and lightweight environment for experimenting with code, handling data, and jotting down ideas on the fly.

It a stage for your early-stage ideas, a place for your drafts, a box for your one-time use.

## It's not another CodePen / CodeSandbox / WebIDE

OneBox is designed for trivial, quick and temporary use cases, which shall:

- **Start instantly!** - No need to make any directory, workspace or project!

- **Focus on Content!** - We cares more about markdown, data, output... rather than HTML preview.

- **See result instantly!** - Builtin viewers, Chrome DevTools etc. Stop switching between tools.

- **Files and editor!** - Quickly create, import, generate and export files with ease (or scripts)

OneBox is not a replacement for CodePen / CodeSandbox / WebIDE etc. but a complement in your work flow.

You can export OneBox workspace to your IDE to continue your work at any time!

## Key Features

- **Browser-based**: Access OneBox directly from your browser, no installations required.

- **üìÅ Multi-file, Multi-tab**: Manage multiple files and tabs seamlessly for organized coding sessions.

- **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run JS/TS in Browser**: Execute JavaScript and TypeScript code directly in your browser, supporting ES modules import/export. Integrated a Chrome DevTools Frontend for inspecting.

- **ü´¥ Drop & Paste Everything**: With copy-pasting or drag-and-drop, you can import files, images, and even entire folders into OneBox.

- **üßò A tiny Workspace that follows your flow**: Treat OneBox as a temporally workspace, at any moment you can export it to your IDE, or clear it for a fresh start.

- **üéπ Keyboard Shortcuts**: Helps you speed-up workflow with shortcuts, including `Cmd+Enter` / `F2` / `Cmd+P` / `Middle Button of Mouse` and more.

## Examples of Use

- Quickly validate and test code snippets.
- Handle small to medium-sized datasets with ease.
- Instantly record and organize thoughts and ideas. _pasting images in markdown? yes we can!_
- Store trivial notes, files and code for later use.
