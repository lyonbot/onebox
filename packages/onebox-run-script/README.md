# onebox-run-script

OneBox plugin that run JavaScript / TypeScript, and provide a Chrome DevTool panel inside.

## How to Use

In JavaScript or TypeScript file, simply press `F5`, or invoke the action via `Cmd+Enter`.

Your code will be executed in a separate iframe, and a Chrome DevTool panel will be opened. You can inspect and view variables, but `debugger` breakpoints still require the real DevTool of your browser.

Once code updated, press `F5` again to re-run. By default we reload the whole iframe, but you can switch to **Incremental Mode** (on the left-top corner of runner panel) to execute the script, retains existing variables in iframe.

To interact with OneBox API, you can use the `ob` object, which is exposed to the global scope of iframe.

```js
var data = ob.readJSON("./data.json");
data.processed = true;
ob.writeFile("./data2.json", data);
```
